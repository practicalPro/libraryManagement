<!-- write the instruction for running the codes -->
_About my work_
I have implemented all 5 routes and pages, and I did node.js for backend for mock data too. I did not implement error handling and beautify the website due to traveling.
_Instruction:_

1. download npm if not done so
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/practicalPro/libraryManagement.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages for front end
   ```sh
   cd frontend/app
   ```
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. start front end server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5. open new terminal
6. Install NPM packages for back end
   ```sh
   cd ../backend
   ```
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
7. start backend server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

best to do start server on different terminal for ease
